# Execute TODO Step by Step

## Task
Follow the TODO list and complete each task step by step, completing only one Task at a time.

## What the AI will do:

1. ✅ Review the current TODO list
2. ✅ Select the next task to execute (prioritize tasks with no dependencies or completed dependencies)
3. ✅ Focus on the current task and complete all related work
4. ✅ Verify task completion, ensure acceptance criteria are met
5. ✅ Update TODO list, mark completed tasks
6. ✅ Record completed tasks and issues encountered
7. ✅ Continue to the next task

## Execution Flow

### Before Starting a Task
- Confirm all task dependencies are completed
- Understand the task's acceptance criteria
- Check if files need to be created or modified

### While Executing a Task
- Focus on the current task, don't handle multiple tasks simultaneously
- Follow project code standards and best practices
- Write clear code and comments
- If blocked, record issues promptly

### After Completing a Task
- Verify acceptance criteria are met
- Update TODO list, mark task as completed
- Record completed work and key decisions
- Check if new dependent tasks can be started

## TODO Update Format

```markdown
- [x] Completed task: Description
  - Completion time: ...
  - Key changes: ...
  - Issues encountered: ...
- [ ] Next task: Description
```

## Important Notes

- **One task at a time**: Don't handle multiple TODO items simultaneously
- **Update TODO promptly**: Update status immediately after completing each task
- **Verify completion criteria**: Ensure tasks are truly completed, not just code written
- **Record key information**: Document important design decisions and issues encountered
- **Stay focused**: Don't skip tasks or change task order unless there's a clear reason
- **When blocked**: If a task cannot be completed, record the reason and mark as blocked
