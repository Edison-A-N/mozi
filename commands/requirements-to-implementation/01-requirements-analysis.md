# Requirements Analysis & Solution Design

## Task
Break down requirements and design solutions based on the background information provided by the user.

## What the AI will do:

1. ✅ Carefully read and analyze the background information provided by the user
2. ✅ Identify core requirements and key functional points
3. ✅ Break down requirements into manageable modules and functional points
4. ✅ Design technical solutions and architecture
5. ✅ Consider edge cases and exception handling
6. ✅ Output structured requirements documentation and design solutions

## Output Requirements

### 1. Goal Definition (CRITICAL)
- **Clear Objectives**: Define the primary goal and success criteria upfront
- **Scope Boundaries**: Explicitly state what is in-scope and out-of-scope
- **Success Metrics**: Define measurable outcomes or acceptance criteria
- **Constraints**: Document known limitations and constraints

### 2. Requirements Breakdown
- Decompose requirements into clear functional modules and sub-functions
- Organize by priority (must-have, should-have, nice-to-have)

### 3. Solution Design
- Provide technology selection, architecture design, data flow design, etc.
- Consider performance, scalability, security, maintainability, etc.

### 4. Format
- Use clear headings, lists, and structured format
- Start with a "Goals & Objectives" section at the top

## Important Notes

- **Define goals first**: Always start by clearly defining the objectives and success criteria
- Fully understand user intent, don't miss key requirements
- Design solutions should be practical, considering existing tech stack and constraints
- If information is insufficient, mark points that need clarification in the output
- Maintain solution executability and verifiability
- Goals should be specific, measurable, and aligned with user's intent
